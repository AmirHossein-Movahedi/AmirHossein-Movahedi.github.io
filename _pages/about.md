My name is AmirHossein Movahedi. I am a master's student in physics at Sharif University of Technology, and this is my academic page. I am interested in quantum computing and quantum algorithms. 

I am also passionate about neuroscience and actively follow the latest developments in the field.

The purpose of this page is to share important notes about physics that may be helpful to other students.
